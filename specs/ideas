subProject

all FRDCSASources are Projects
CapabilityRequests

either we are developing the codebase or we aren't
if we are, then boss handles its storage, etc, and maintaining the duality.

each project has a list of capabilities, requirements, features, etc.
BOSS tracks the status

we request  that we have the  ability to track  capabilities.  we also
request that we have  DRM.  We do not need to declare  a new system or
project  for   each  new  capability.   Capabilities   can  be  formed
dynamically and automatically, and can be extracted from websites.

A  project  consists   of  a  set  of  goals,   capabilities,  and  an
implementation.

(Software to handle reputation management in general.)




here is the way this system works.

we have a capabilities management system
