  <title>Boosting Open Source Software (BOSS)</title>
  <short-description>
    A software engineering manager for project management.
  </short-description>
  <medium-description>
    BOSS handles certain aspects of software development, from mundane
    code like  responsibilities to higher  level planning.  Similarly,
    several  databases  about  the  software, possibly  including  the
    Microtheories   and   assertion   databases  regarding   developed
    software,  are   maintained  using  BOSS.   In   the  future  more
    managerial type tasks will be assumed.

      things: It scans  a project for information about  hooks that it
